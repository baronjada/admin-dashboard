# Admin Dashboard

Final project within the 'Intermediate HTML & CSS' course as part of the wider 'Full Stack JS' path to solidify understanding of topics such as CSS grid.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML and CSS

I have aimed to use mainly CSS grids to position the different sections of the page such as the sidebar, header and main content and used grid-template-areas to achieve this and make it easy to target elements within the CSS for styling.

I then opted to use CSS flexbox for some of the child grid items such as for the profile info section in the top right of the header section, and the profile info child containers within the 'Trending' card component at the bottom left. I found this method easier to use for the more simple, one-dimensional layouts.

## Lessons Learned:

I really got to flex my skills within CSS and all that I have been focusing on recently within the 'Intermediate HTML and CSS' section of The Odin Project's 'Full Stack JS' course such as using CSS variables to make styling consistent across all the sections of the page, adding hover transitions to the menu items and icons across the 'Your Projects' cards for example.

I also really enjoyed getting to grips with the strength of CSS grid and flexbox and where is more appropriate to use each one depending on the content needing to be positioned and how to best nest elements within containers in order to control the positioning most effectively.

I also found a Stack Overflow article which helped solidify my understanding of image positioning and how wrapper containers can be used to help control the position and scale of an image using properties such as 'object-fit' to ensure the profile photos are centred and all at consistent heights - I feel this will be so useful going forward for future projects.

## What I Could Do Better:

I didn't necessarily focus on making this project responsive therefore I am aware the cards may spill slightly on smaller breakpoints. However this is something I am learning more about in the near future so would be a great opportunity to re-visit this project and add some finishing touches in terms of responsive design.

Update 26/07/25: Shortly after the above reflection, I re-visited some of my prior learning on grid and used grid-row-start and grid-row-end properties along with tweaking grid-template-column and grid-template-row to adjust the positioning of the header and main content elements.
